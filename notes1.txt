Python is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted programming language that is known for its simple syntax and readability.
It supports multiple programming paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Key features of Python
  1.Interpreted Language
 	  Code is executed line by line using the Python interpreter.
  2.High-Level Language
    Easy to read and write because the syntax is close to English.
  3.Dynamically Typed
    You don't need to declare data types explicitly.
  4.Portable & Platform Independent
    Same Python program works on Windows, Linux, macOS.
  5.Extensive Standard Library
    Provides modules for file handling, math, random, datetime, etc.
  6.Supports Multiple Paradigms
    Procedural programming
    Object-oriented programming
    Functional programming
  7.Open Source
    Free to use and maintained by a large community.
    
Python Interpreter vs Interactive Mode
  The Python interpreter is the program that reads and executes Python code line by line.
  It takes a .py file and runs it.
  Interactive mode is a mode of the interpreter where Python executes each line immediately as you type it.

VARIABLES
  A variable is a name that stores a value in memory.
  It acts as a container for data.

  x = 10
  name = "Ananya"
  Here, x and name are variables.

  Types of Variables 
    1.Local Variable – inside a function
    2.Global Variable – outside all functions
  
IDENTIFIERS
  An identifier is the name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, etc.
  
  Rules for Identifiers (Must write in exam)
    1.Must start with a letter or underscore
      valid → name, _value
      invalid → 1name, @data
    2.Can contain letters, digits, underscores only
      total1, value_2  ✔
      a-b, x@y         ✘
    3.Case-sensitive
      age ≠ Age ≠ AGE

    4.Cannot use Python keywords
      Examples of keywords:if, else, for, while, class, def, True, False, break, return, import
      if = 10   # invalid
    5.No spaces allowed
      total marks  ✘
      total_marks ✔
    6.Cannot use special characters(Except underscore _)
      name@  ✘
      name_ ✔

ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
    +   (Addition) → adds two values
        (Example: 5 + 3 = 8)
    -   (Subtraction) → subtracts right operand from left
        (Example: 10 - 4 = 6)
    *   (Multiplication) → multiplies values
        (Example: 6 * 7 = 42)
    /   (Division) → normal division, always gives float
        (Example: 7 / 2 = 3.5)
    //   (Floor Division) → gives integer part only
        (Example: 7 // 2 = 3)
    %   (Modulus) → returns remainder
        (Example: 10 % 3 = 1)
    **   (Exponent) → power
         (Example: 2 ** 3 = 8)
VALUES AND TYPES
	A value is any piece of data used in a Python program.

	Types in Python:
		1. Numeric Types
			Used to store numbers.
				✔ int – integer values
				Examples: 10, -5, 0
				✔ float – decimal values
				Examples: 3.14, 2.0
				✔ complex – complex numbers (a + bj)
				Examples: 2+3j, -4j
			
		2. Boolean Type
			✔ bool – represents True/False
			Examples: True, False			
			Used in conditions and comparisons.

		3. Sequence Types
				Ordered collection of items.			
					✔ string (str) – sequence of characters				
					Example: "hello", 'A'				
					✔ list – mutable sequence			
					Example: [1, 2, 3]			
					✔ tuple – immutable sequence			
					Example: (4, 5, 6)

		4. Set Types	
				Unordered collection of unique items.		
					✔ set
					Example: {1, 2, 3}
					✔ frozenset – immutable set
					Example: frozenset({1, 2, 3})
		5. Dictionary Type
				Stores key–value pairs.			
					✔ dict
					Example: {"name": "Ananya", "age": 20}
		6. None Type
				Represents “no value”.		
				✔ NoneType
				Example: x = None

STATEMENTS IN PYTHON
	A statement is an instruction the Python interpreter can execute.Each line is a separate statement.
	
	Types of Statements:
		1. Assignment Statements
				name = "Python"
				age = 30
		2. Conditional Statements
				age = 20
				if age > 18:
				    print("You are an adult")     # Output: You are an adult
				else:
				    print("You are a minor")	
		3. Looping Statements
				for i in range(3):
				    print("Hello")                 # Output: Hello (3 times)		
		4. Import Statements
				import math
				print(math.sqrt(16))               # Output: 4.0		
		5. Exception Handling Statements
				try:
				    x = 1 / 0
				except ZeroDivisionError:
				    print("Division by zero not allowed")  # Output: Division by zero not allowed		
		6. Flow Control Statements
				break – stop loop		
				continue – skip iteration
				pass – do nothing
				return – exit function
		7.MULTI-LINE STATEMENTS
			✔ Using backslash \
					s = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
					    4 + 5 + 6 + \
					    7 + 8 + 9
					print(s)                          # Output: 45		
			✔ Using parentheses ()
					n = (1 * 2 * 3 +
					     4 + 5 + 6)
					print(n)                          # Output: 21
			✔ Using square brackets []
					footballers = [
					    "Messi",
					    "Neymar",
					    "Suarez"
					]
					print(footballers)                # Output: ['Messi', 'Neymar', 'Suarez']		
			✔ Using braces {}
					numbers = {1, 2, 3,
					           4, 5}
					print(numbers)                    # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
		8.Indentation in Python
			Indentation = spaces at the beginning of a line.
			Python uses indentation to group code blocks.
			✔ Rules of Indentation
				1.Use 4 spaces (PEP 8).
				2.Blocks must have same indentation level.
				3.Don’t mix tabs and spaces.
				(Wrong indent → IndentationError.)
		9.COMMENTS IN PYTHON
			Comments are ignored during execution.			
			✔ Single-line Comments
					# Adding two numbers
					a, b = 5, 10
					print(a + b)                     # Output: 15			
			✔ Multi-line Comments
				Method 1: Using multiple #
					# Line 1
					# Line 2
					# Line 3
					print("Hello")                   # Output: Hello			
				Method 2: Using triple quotes
					"""
					This is a multi-line comment
					"""
					print("Python")                  # Output: Python
		10.Docstring
				A docstring (documentation string) is a string written inside a function, class, or module to describe what it does.
				It appears as the first statement inside the block and is written using triple quotes (""" """).			
				Python stores docstrings and uses them as official documentation for your code.
				Example
						def add(a, b):
						    """This function returns the sum of two numbers."""
						    return a + b
						
						print(add(10, 20))          # Output: 30
						print(add.__doc__)          # Output: This function returns the s
